  <h1>OpenBSD</h1>

  <p>
    Despite popular belief, OpenBSD's security is actually lacking in a lot of ways.
  </p>

  <h2 id="half-baked-mitigations"><a href="#half-baked-mitigations">Half-Baked Mitigations</a></h2>

  <p>
    Many of OpenBSD's exploit mitigations are actually half-baked or even useless. This is a nonexhaustive list of a few
    of them.

    <ul class="ullist">
      <li class="lilist">
        One of OpenBSD's popular features is its <a href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20160527203200">"W^X"</a>
        but OpenBSD's W^X is not a complete implementation. It <a href="https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/9f25ea04447">only
        prevents someone from creating a memory mapping with writable and executable permissions</a> but does not prevent someone
        from transitioning a writable memory mapping to executable which makes it not very hard to bypass. An attacker can
        create a ROP chain to transition the mapping to executable and execute their shellcode from there. Many exploits in the
        wild have been shown to do this instead of purely relying on ROP since that takes more effort. Complete implementations
        are already found in other operating systems like <a
        href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/02/23/mitigating-arbitrary-native-code-execution/">Windows'
        ACG</a>, iOS' code signing and so on. <a
        href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1562410493-8661-1-git-send-email-s.mesoraca16@gmail.com/">Even Linux is working on it</a>,
        albeit a few decades late. The idea of W^X was not novel to OpenBSD either. The first complete implementation was
        <a href="https://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/mprotect.txt">present in PaX</a> ~20 years ago which itself has roots in the
        <a href="https://www.openwall.com/linux/">OpenWall project</a>.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        Another of OpenBSD's mitigations is <a href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20170622065629">TRAPSLED</a>.
        This aims to neutralize NOP sleds but this mitigation <a
        href="https://isopenbsdsecu.re/mitigations/trapsled/">doesn't really do
        anything with ASLR</a>. TRAPSLED can definitely be useful for some non-security use cases but it is absolutely not an
        exploit mitigation.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=150317547021396&w=2">RETGUARD</a> is a supposed mitigation against ROP
        but it <a href="https://nitter.net/lazytyped/status/899173090550312961">is trivially bypassed with an arbitrary read</a>.
        It is not a solid mitigation for ROP unlike proper mitigations such as <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ShadowCallStack.html">
        ShadowCallStack</a>, <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/4d/2a/control-flow-enforcement-technology-preview.pdf">
        CET</a>, <a href="https://grsecurity.net/rap_faq">PaX RAP</a>, etc. Meaningful defenses against ROP are again, already found in
        other operating systems like <a
        href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-kernel-internals/understanding-hardware-enforced-stack-protection/ba-p/1247815">
        Windows' CET</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preparing_your_app_to_work_with_pointer_authentication">iOS'
        PAC</a> and <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/queue-hardening-enhancements.html">Android's ShadowCallStack</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 id="missing-mitigations"><a href="#missing-mitigations">Missing Mitigations</a></h2>

  <p>
    As well as developing half-baked mitigations, OpenBSD also lacks plenty of modern mitigations completely. Again, this is a
    nonexhaustive list and there are still plenty more examples than the ones listed here.

    <ul class="ullist">
      <li class="lilist">
        OpenBSD has no reliable protection against code reuse attacks. It only has a few mitigations that aren't very effective
        as discussed above. It lacks both forward and backward-edge protection meanwhile Windows has a coarse-grained forward-edge
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity">Control-Flow Integrity</a> (CFI) implementation known as
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard">Control Flow Guard</a> as well as
        backward-edge protection via <a
        href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/4d/2a/control-flow-enforcement-technology-preview.pdf">
        Intel CET's shadow stacks</a>; iOS uses an <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preparing_your_app_to_work_with_pointer_authentication">
        improved implementation of ARM's Pointer Authentication Codes</a> (PAC), ensuring
        backward and forward-edge protection; Android <a
        href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/06/compiler-based-security-mitigations-in.html">uses Clang's
        fine-grained forward-edge CFI</a> and <a
        href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/queue-hardening-enhancements.html">ShadowCallStack</a>.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        Verified boot is an important security feature that eliminates privileged malware persistence by verifying the integrity
        of the entire base operating system. This is most commonly used on mobile devices with <a
        href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/">Android</a> and <a
        href="https://www.apple.com/ca/business/docs/site/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf">iOS</a> both having solid implementations but desktop
        operating systems have made substantial progress on this as well, mainly <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-jo/HT208330">
        macOS</a> and <a
        href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/17/secured-core-pcs-a-brief-showcase-of-chip-to-cloud-security-against-kernel-attacks/">
        Windows</a> whereas any form of verified boot is nonexistent on OpenBSD.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        <a href="http://phrack.org/issues/52/6.html#article">Trusted Path Execution</a> (TPE) prevents an attacker from executing arbitary code
        from the filesystem and can be used as a supplement to proper W^X to prevent dynamic native code execution in both memory and the
        filesystem but, like the lack of actual W^X, OpenBSD also has no TPE.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        OpenBSD has no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control">Mandatory Access Control</a> (MAC) system like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor">AppArmor</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux">
        SELinux</a> which prevents you from fully locking down user space. In comparison to, for example, Android in which it uses a
        <a href="https://source.android.com/security/selinux/">strict, full system SELinux policy</a> to confine every single process in
        user space and is a core part of the security model. Pledge and Unveil, while being great sandboxing tools, are not a replacement
        for a proper MAC system. It still fully trusts the applications as it has to be implemented within its source code and it isn't
        nearly as fine-grained as a good SELinux setup.
      </li>

      <li class="lilist">
        OpenBSD also lacks any form of GUI isolation which will make sandbox escapes incredibly easy. It uses <a
        href="https://www.xenocara.org/">Xenocara</a>, a fork of X11 which is
        notorious for being insecure and <a
        href="https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html">not implementing GUI isolation</a>
        and OpenBSD does not support <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 id="lack-of-innovations"><a href="#lack-of-innovations">Lack of Innovations</a></h2>

  <p>
    OpenBSD hasn't really innovated much and many of its (real) mitigations were developed long before OpenBSD implemented them such as W^X
    and ASLR which <a href="https://pax.grsecurity.net/">were developed by PaX</a> (PAX_MPROTECT and PAX_ASLR). OpenBSD tries to hide
    this fact with sly wording such as: <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/innovations.html">"ASLR: OpenBSD 3.4 was the first widely used
    operating system to provide it by default."</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="good-things"><a href="#good-things">The Good Things</a></h2>

  <p>
    Although, despite the many issues with it, some of OpenBSD's mitigations are pretty solid like <a
    href="https://ftp.openbsd.org/papers/eurobsdcon2009/otto-malloc.pdf">their malloc implementation</a> and OpenBSD excels in their
    cryptography and standalone tools, just not really when it comes to general OS security.
  </p>

  <h2 id="other-criticism"><a href="#other-criticism">Other Criticism</a></h2>

  <p>
    OpenBSD has also received a lot of criticism from many respected security experts. One example is <a
      href="https://grsecurity.net/~spender/exploits/exp_moosecox.c">Brad Spengler</a>, the developer of grsecurity.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2 id="alternative"><a href="#alternative">Alternative</a></h2>

  <p>
    A more promising alternative to OpenBSD is <a href="https://hardenedbsd.org/">HardenedBSD</a>. There are
    advantages/disadvantages of HardenedBSD over OpenBSD. HardenedBSD has many mitigations OpenBSD does not such as CFI,
    SafeStack, SEGVGUARD, a proper W^X implementation and more but it lacks things OpenBSD has such as LibreSSL, a
    hardened malloc etc.
